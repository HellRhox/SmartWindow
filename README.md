# SmartWindow
A try on a SmartWindow with ESP8266 using Arduino and C/C++ code.

## Used in this Projekt

* 2 IoT Octopus (ESP8266 on a bigger board with Adafruit NeoPixels and other extras)
* [Adafruit VL6180X](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3316)
* Radarsensor (in my case a RCWL-0516)

## Needed Librarys

* Adafruit IO
* Adafruit NeoPixel
* Adafruit VL6180x

## Prepering the Arduino IDE

To use the ESP8266 you need to include http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json in your boardmanager settings.
Then go and download the ESP boardinformation in your boardmanager.
